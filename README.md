```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

##Introduction

SING method is used in extracting joint non-gaussian components from different datasets when wiping off gaussian noise. This is a tutorial example supporting the paper **Simultaneous Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (SING) for Data Integration in Neuroimaging Benjamin Risk, Irina Gaynanova** https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00597v1

The function codes are saved in `jngcaFunctions.R` and `generate_data.R`.
The data processing is saved in `My example.R` while the figures of outcome are saved in My example2.R`.

###Generate data



```{r cars}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
